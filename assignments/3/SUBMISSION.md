# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
[Overall as a group, we did what we were all individually asked to do and collectively. Each teammate created their own 
version of the AI-generated CSS and prompt. We noticed that more often than not, AI could quickly produce a design based
on our prompts, but they were never perfect and have some mistakes when compared to our vision of what we wanted. 
Abraham went for a darker theme, focusing on a webpage that was aesthetically pleasing. His layout was more condensed 
vertically, making it easier to see everything without scrolling and added a subtler animation than our handwritten css.
Justin went for a more complex layout, evoking the aesthetics of the movie, The Matrix.While the final result was quite 
impressive, and we learned a lot of what is possible with css styling, we all felt the theme was too distracting to base 
our hybrid css on. Similar to Abraham, Jiaming went for an aesthetic layout that was clean, but opted for a lighter 
color scheme similar to the handwritten one. Joaquin went a style inspired by Windows xp, it gave an interesting result
but was overall a bit basic. When building the Hybrid CSS together, we combined the style.css file with some sections 
from each of the other Ai files.Our layouts looked pretty similar outside of aesthetic choices, so we ended up choosing
a feature we really liked from each of our ai styles and incorporating it into the handwritten css.]

## Individual Reflections

### [Abraham Kao] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
[The hand written CSS helped me better understand how to organize a webpage using flexbox and other layout techniques. 
Using spacing and shadows helped make the sections look more clean and readable. I struggled a bit when it came to 
balancing out colors and spacing, making sure the design wasn't super crowded.]

### [Justin Santos] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[I used ChatGPT to generate this Matrix-like style. It's not a style I would personally use, but I wanted to push the ai
to see what kind of effects would be possible with just CSS. I was really impressed by the result, especially the
animated background the ai was able to create without any additional tech. It also only took one input to get the result
I wanted, but It may be due to how descriptive I was in the original prompt. I think this was a good way for me to learn
about how far we can push css, as I wasn't expecting this level of detail.]

### [Jiaming Yu] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[The AI tools I am using to generating the CSS is DeepSeek. The first prompt I am giving out to DeepSeek is not much 
details, but it is working with the ways I want. Personally I don't really have art talents. This means that my CSS 
style or AI-CSS style will look not really fantastic, but ok to read. As there might be some unsatisify due to my 
non-details prompt that I give to AI. But I can keep chatting 2, or more prompts to make a version that I am satisfy 
with. What I learn from the AI is actually a good tools to help to design an interface to make it looks better, but not 
enough because it seems still rough as the ideas might not really match what the user might want.]

### [Joaquin Molina] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
[I used ChatGPT for the style. It was created with the idea to imitate Windows xp. The resulting page was effective and
functional, so I was happy with the result. I think it did only an ok job of imitating Windows xp, however this could 
likely be improved with further prompting. What I learned is that the AI is very good at giving you a rough functional 
idea of what you want, but if you desire your specific vision you will either have to prompt further or modify the 
results.]

## Group Preferred Version
[We preferred Jiaming's layout as it was aesthetically pleasing and easy to read, but we liked the colorscheme of
Abraham's work.]

## Collaboration Experience
[We focused a lot on communication and helping each other out whenever we faced a problem. What we all found challenging
was getting used to github and using the terminal as we faced quite a lot of problems setting it up. We noticed outside
of aesthetic preferences, we all had a similar header and body layout so we decided to keep our hybrid the same, and
each pick a section from our ai layouts and implement them into the handwritten to get a design that is a proper
combination of all of our work. We think going forward, deciding on work distribution early will help make the process
smooth. Though we had trouble with github and collaboration, the learning experience will also be valuable in the future
as we will be using doing something similar in future classes and when we start working as well.]
