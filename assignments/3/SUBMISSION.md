### [Member 2 Name] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[I used ChatGPT to generate this Matrix-like style. It's not a style I would personally use, but I wanted to push the ai
to see what kind of effects would be possible with just CSS. I was really impressed by the result, especially the
animated background the ai was able to create without any additional tech. It also only took one input to get the result
I wanted, but It may be due to how descriptive I was in the original prompt. I think this was a good way for me to learn
about how far we can push css, as I wasn't expecting this level of detail.]

### [Jiaming Yu] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[The AI tools I am using to genenrating the CSS is DeepSeek. The first prompt I am giving out to DeepSeek is not much details, but it is working with the ways I want. Personally I don't really have art talents. This means that my CSS style or AI-CSS style will look not really fantastic, but ok to read. As there might be some unsatisify due to my non-details prompt that I give to AI. But I can keep chatting 2, or more promtps to make a version that I am satisify with. What I learn from the AI is acutally a good tools to help to design an interface to make it looks better, but not enough because it seems still rough as the ideas might not really match what the user might wanted.]
