# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
Overall as a group, we did what we were all individually asked to do and collectively. Each teammate created their own version of the AI-generated CSS and prompt. We noticed that more often than not, AI could quickly produce a design based on our prompts but they were never perfect and have some mistakes when compared to our vision of what we wanted. When building the Hybrid CSS together, we combined the style.css file with some sections from each of the other Ai files.

[Write a collaborative analysis comparing the different approaches. Each member should contribute to this section.]

## Individual Reflections

### [Abraham Kao] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
The hand written CSS helped me better understand how to organize a webpage using flexbox and other layout techniques. Using spacing and shadows helped make the sections look more clean and readable.
I struggled a bit when it came to balancing out colors and spacing, making sure the design wasn't super crowded.

### [Member 2 Name] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[I used ChatGPT to generate this Matrix-like style. It's not a style I would personally use, but I wanted to push the ai
to see what kind of effects would be possible with just CSS. I was really impressed by the result, especially the
animated background the ai was able to create without any additional tech. It also only took one input to get the result
I wanted, but It may be due to how descriptive I was in the original prompt. I think this was a good way for me to learn
about how far we can push css, as I wasn't expecting this level of detail.]

### [Jiaming Yu] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[The AI tools I am using to genenrating the CSS is DeepSeek. The first prompt I am giving out to DeepSeek is not much details, but it is working with the ways I want. Personally I don't really have art talents. This means that my CSS style or AI-CSS style will look not really fantastic, but ok to read. As there might be some unsatisify due to my non-details prompt that I give to AI. But I can keep chatting 2, or more promtps to make a version that I am satisify with. What I learn from the AI is acutally a good tools to help to design an interface to make it looks better, but not enough because it seems still rough as the ideas might not really match what the user might wanted.]

### [Member 4 Name] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
[Individual reflection on AI prompting with images and lessons learned]

## Group Preferred Version
[Explain which version the group prefers and why - this should be a consensus decision]

## Collaboration Experience
We focused a lot on communication and helping each other out whenever we faced a problem. What we all found challenging was getting used to github and using the terminal as we faced quite a lot of problems setting it up.
