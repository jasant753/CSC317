### [Jiaming Yu] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[The AI tools I am using to genenrating the CSS is DeepSeek. The first prompt I am giving out to DeepSeek is not much details, but it is working with the ways I want. Personally I don't really have art talents. This means that my CSS style or AI-CSS style will look not really fantastic, but ok to read. As there might be some unsatisify due to my non-details prompt that I give to AI. But I can keep chatting 2, or more promtps to make a version that I am satisify with. What I learn from the AI is acutally a good tools to help to design an interface to make it looks better, but not enough because it seems still rough as the ideas might not really match what the user might wanted.]
