Ive attached a HTML file of a student profile webpage. Please make a CSS file using a darker color palette that focuses on contrasting colors. Color scheme: Black/gray and white Typography style: something aesthetically pleasing and easy to read. Layout: I want the webpage to be separated into 3 sections, 2 boxes split down the middle on the top-half of the page and the bottom half to be split into separate boxes. I want the profile to be in the top left box, not too big, not too small with name and biography under it. The top right box should be skills and experience. I want the bottom half of the page to be split into sections for 3 projects and make sure they are evenly spaced out. I would like the profile to have a white background while the skills and experience to have a black background while the text is white. Design Element: please give the profile picture some simple animation, to make it stand out. Do not make any changes to the HTML file at all
